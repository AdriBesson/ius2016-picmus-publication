@article{Chen2015,
abstract = {The interest of compressive sampling in ultrasound imaging has been recently extensively evaluated by several research teams. Following the different application setups, it has been shown that the RF data may be reconstructed from a small number of measurements and/or using a reduced number of ultrasound pulse emissions. Nevertheless, RF image spatial resolution, contrast and signal to noise ratio are affected by the limited bandwidth of the imaging transducer and the physical phenomenon related to US wave propagation. To overcome these limitations, several deconvolution-based image processing techniques have been proposed to enhance the ultrasound images. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, named compressive deconvolution, that reconstructs enhanced RF images from compressed measurements. Exploiting an unified formulation of the direct acquisition model, combining random projections and 2D convolution, the benefit of our approach is the joint data volume reduction and image quality improvement. The proposed optimization method, based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, is evaluated on both simulated and in vivo data.},

In this letter, we present a data-driven scheme for learning optimal thresholding functions for ISTA. The proposed scheme is obtained by relating iterations of ISTA to layers of a simple deep neural network (DNN) and developing a corresponding error backpropagation algorithm that allows to fine-tune the thresholding functions. Simulations on sparse statistical signals illustrate potential gains in estimation quality due to the proposed data adaptive ISTA.},

@article{montaldo_uffc_2014,
abstract = {The emergence of ultrafast frame rates in ultrasonic imaging has been recently made possible by the development of new imaging modalities such as transient elastography. Data acquisition rates reaching more than thousands of images per second enable the real-time visualization of shear mechanical waves propagating in biological tissues, which convey information about local viscoelastic properties of tissues. The first proposed approach for reaching such ultrafast frame rates consists of transmitting plane waves into the medium. However, because the beamforming process is then restricted to the receive mode, the echographic images obtained in the ultrafast mode suffer from a low quality in terms of resolution and contrast and affect the robustness of the transient elastography mode. It is here proposed to improve the beamforming process by using a coherent recombination of compounded plane-wave transmissions to recover high-quality echographic images without degrading the high frame rate capabilities. A theoretical model is derived for the comparison between the proposed method and the conventional B-mode imaging in terms of contrast, signal-to-noise ratio, and resolution. Our model predicts that a significantly smaller number of insonifications, 10 times lower, is sufficient to reach an image quality comparable to conventional B-mode. Theoretical predictions are confirmed by in vitro experiments performed in tissue-mimicking phantoms. Such results raise the appeal of coherent compounds for use with standard imaging modes such as B-mode or color flow. Moreover, in the context of transient elastography, ultrafast frame rates can be preserved while increasing the image quality compared with flat insonifications. Improvements on the transient elastography mode are presented and discussed.},

This paper first revisits the compressive sampling theory and then proposes several strategies to performcompressive sampling in the context of ultrasound imaging.

abstract = {This work proposes a component based model for the raw ultrasound signals acquired by the transducer elements. Based on this approach, before undergoing the standard digital processing chain, every sampled raw signal is first decomposed into a smooth background signal and a strong reflectors component. The decomposition allows for a suited processing scheme to be adjusted for each component individually. We demonstrate the potential benefit of this approach in image enhancement by suppressing side lobe artifacts, and in improvement of digital data compression. Applying our proposed processing schemes to real cardiac ultrasound data, we show that by separating the two components and compressing them individually, over twenty-fold reduction of the data size is achieved while retaining the image contents.},
