## Abstract
Classical ultrasound image reconstruction mainly relies on the well-known Delay-And-Sum (DAS) beamforming for its simplicity and real-time capability. Sparse regularization methods propose an alternative to DAS which lead to a better inversion of the ill-posed problem resulting from the acoustic wave propagation. In the following work, a new sparse regularization method is proposed which includes a component-based modelling of the radio-frequency images as well as a point-spread-function-adaptive sparsity prior. The proposed method, evaluated on the PICMUS dataset, outperforms the classical DAS in terms of contrast and resolution.
